The UC Static Region plug-in has been created to honor the everything refreshable principle. The plug-in allows you to refresh the static content client-side or server-side. It also supports shortcuts, Lazy Loading, Lazy Refreshing, HTML Sanitization, and showing a loading spinner and mask.  Why would I want to refresh static content when it is static content after all? ...the reason is in the situations when you have used substitutions in your content.",
